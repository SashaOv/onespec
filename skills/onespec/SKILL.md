# OneSpec Onboard

You are onboarding to a project that uses (or should use) OneSpec. Your job is to discover the spec landscape, understand its structure, and produce a clear map of what exists and what's missing.

## Process

Follow the steps and rules below, then continue with the onboard-specific steps.

When the project has change specs, read [the change-spec record](change-spec.md) for their layout and workflow.
## Finding and parsing specs

### Find specs

Use the `refines:` frontmatter graph to identify spec files positively:

1. **Files with `refines:` frontmatter** — these are specs. Collect every file path listed in their `refines:` values; those are also specs (parent or root specs). Repeat transitively until no new files are found.
2. **Remaining Markdown files** (not yet identified) — apply heuristic exclusion: skip README, CHANGELOG, LICENSE, TODO lists, contribution guides, developer runbooks, and coding-conventions or process documents. These describe *how to work on* the project, not *what it must do*, and have no implementable behavioral contract. Any unexcluded remainder is likely a root spec with no children yet.

**Change specs** describe planned, time-bounded changes that fold back into the parent spec once implemented.

By default, change specs live in `docs/todo/`. A project can override this location in its root spec — when scanning, look for an explicit declaration there before falling back to the default.

A change spec links to the spec it amends with a `refines:` frontmatter edge:

```yaml
---
refines: docs/spec.md
---
```

Lifecycle:

1. Author the change spec in the change-spec folder, with `refines:` to the parent it modifies.
2. Implement; coverage of its chunks rises to 100%.
3. Fold the now-stable durable content into the parent spec and retire the change spec; the `onewrap` skill does this.

A change spec at 100% coverage that has not been retired is a smell: either the parent is missing durable content from the change, or the change spec is forgotten. Surface this in reports.

### Extract spec chunks

Read each identified spec file fully, then split it into chunks by heading. Each heading (any level) defines a spec chunk. Record:
- the heading text
- the file path
- the body text under that heading (up to the next heading of same or higher level)

Classify headings that are purely structural — umbrella sections whose normative content lives entirely in their sub-headings, with no prose of their own — as "not applicable" rather than extracting them as independent chunks.

### Scope and search strategy

Limit review work to source code files and Markdown files in the workspace.

Ignore generated, vendored, dependency, build, cache, coverage, lockfile, and binary outputs unless the user explicitly asks to include them.

When classifying evidence:
- **implementation**: prefer source code files. Markdown may provide supporting context, but do not treat ordinary prose as implementation evidence.
- **test**: prefer test files, test modules, or executable examples in source code. Markdown examples count only when they are clearly verification artifacts used by the project.

### Search for implementation and tests

For each spec chunk, search the codebase for code and tests that appear to implement or verify it. Use a combination of:
- semantic search for the concepts described in the chunk
- grep for key terms, function names, or identifiable phrases from the spec

Classify what you find:
- **implementation**: source code that appears to implement the behavior described
- **test**: test code that appears to verify the behavior described

Be conservative. Only claim a match when the code clearly relates to the spec chunk. When uncertain, say so.

### Refinement gaps

When a prompt asks for refinement gaps, use these categories:
- **Broken refinement edges**: a `refines:` value that does not match any discovered spec file.
- **Unrefineable breadth**: a spec chunk that is too broad to implement directly, has no child spec refining it, and has no direct implementation.

### Reporting limits

Always report full counts for each section.

When a section would contain more than 10 items, show the 10 most important examples and summarize the remainder as omitted items.

## Rules

- Do not modify any files. This is a read-only review.
- Do not invent spec chunks that aren't in the spec files.
- If a spec chunk is too abstract to map to code (e.g., a principle like "Simplicity"), classify it as "not applicable" rather than a gap.
- If the project has no spec files, say so and stop.

## `(spec)` annotation format

When suggesting `(spec)` annotations, use exactly this format — no variations:

```
(spec) <heading text>
```

- No colon after `(spec)`.
- No file path. The heading alone identifies the chunk.
- No `§` section sign or any other signs.
- If two specs share a heading, disambiguate with the parent heading: `(spec) <parent heading> / <heading>`.
- Use idiomatic comment syntax for the target language (`#`, `//`, `"""..."""`, etc.).

## Required report section: Change specs

Every onboard and review report includes this section, between "Refinement gaps" and "Not applicable":

```
### Change specs (<count>)
Spec files in the change-spec folder, with their lifecycle status.

- **<file path>** (`refines: <parent>`) — <covered>/<total> chunks covered
  - **READY TO RETIRE**: 100% covered; run `onewrap` to fold it into <parent> and retire this file.
  - or: <count> chunks remaining
```

If the project has no change specs, omit the section.


### Build the spec graph

Draw the refinement graph from `refines:` edges. Identify:
- the root spec(s)
- refinement chains (parent → child)
- broken edges (`refines:` targets that don't match any discovered spec file)
- leaf specs (specs with no children refining them)

### Produce the onboarding report

Output a structured report in this format:

```
## OneSpec Onboard — <project name>

### Spec graph

<Root spec>
├── <Child spec 1>
│   └── <Grandchild spec>
└── <Child spec 2>

<total> spec files, <chunks> spec chunks, <edges> refinement edges

### Coverage summary

<covered>/<total> spec chunks covered (<percentage>%)
<partially> partially covered (implementation or tests, not both)
<gaps> gaps (neither implementation nor tests)

### What's well covered

Areas where specs have matching implementation and tests.

- **<heading>** (<file path>)
  - implementation: <file>:<line> — `<function or class>`
  - test: <file>:<line> — `<test function>`

### What's partially covered

Spec chunks where implementation or tests were found, but not both.

- **<heading>** (<file path>)
  - implementation: <file>:<line> — `<function>`
  - test: none found — **gap**

### Gaps

Spec chunks where neither implementation nor tests were found.

- **<heading>** (<file path>) — no implementation or tests found

### Refinement gaps

Spec chunks that are too broad to implement directly and have no child spec
refining them. Broken `refines:` edges.

- **<heading>** (<file path>) — needs child spec to refine before implementation
- **<file path>** — `refines: <target>` does not match any spec file

### Not applicable

Spec chunks that describe process, principles, or non-functional aspects
that don't map to specific code, and umbrella sections whose normative
content lives entirely in their sub-headings.

- **<heading>** (<file path>) — <reason>
```

Keep the structure above, but if any section exceeds 10 items, show the 10 most important examples and summarize the remainder.

### Recommend next steps

Based on the report, suggest a prioritized list of actions to improve spec coverage:

1. **Fix broken refinement edges** — these block the graph from working
2. **Add `(spec)` annotations** — for code and tests that clearly implement spec chunks but lack references
3. **Write missing tests** — for spec chunks with implementation but no tests
4. **Write missing specs** — for significant implementation areas with no spec coverage
5. **Refine broad specs** — spec chunks too broad to implement directly that need child specs

Limit to the top 5–10 most impactful actions.
